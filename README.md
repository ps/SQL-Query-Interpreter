Simple SQL Query Interpreter
============================
Full specification and readme yet to come.

## Running Instructions ##
Run 'make' to compile everything. 'SampleQueryUsage.java' contains examples on how to use to 
module for different types of queries. 'Query.java' holds the query parent class as well as Select, Insert, Update, Delete
child classes. All of the interpretation happens within that file. 

Unit test have also been made, simply run 'java QueryTest'.
